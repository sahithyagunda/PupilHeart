ðŸ“± PupilHeart: Mobile HRV Monitoring via Pupil Response

PupilHeart is a novel system for monitoring Heart Rate Variability (HRV) using only a smartphone's front-facing camera and facial recognition unlocking. HRV is a key indicator of heart health, linked to cardiovascular conditions, stress levels, and overall autonomic nervous system activity.

Traditional HRV monitoring methods require professional equipment or wearables, which can be costly and inconvenient. We explore a new method based on the correlation between pupil size and heart rate, both regulated by the autonomic nervous system.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insight
Pupil size changes in response to physiological states (e.g., fear, stress) are connected to heart rate changes. With over 800M+ smartphones supporting face unlock, we propose using pupil dynamics captured during phone unlocking as a proxy for HRV â€” offering a non-intrusive, cost-effective alternative.

 How It Works
Capture: Use the phoneâ€™s front camera during facial recognition unlocks.

Analyze: Detect subtle pupil size changes.

Infer: Estimate HRV from time-domain variations in pupil response.

 Key Advantages
Convenience: No extra hardware or user effort needed.

Scalability: Uses everyday smartphone behavior (face unlock).

Data richness: Captures HRV across various states and times.
